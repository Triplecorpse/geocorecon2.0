# geocorecon 2.0
- you should not seek a field to fill. The program makes it for you. Though you should fill the fields correctly
- you can now use both mathematical and geographical representations (NSWE and +-)
- you should not seek degree sign - there is a button that pastes it
- map added
----------------
# instructions
- as in previous versions, formats are: dd°mm'ss", dd°mm.m', dd.d° with one spacebar as separator. You can omit degree sign ONLY in d.dd. I wanted to make spacebars remover but it seems very boring to me. So I added only regex validatoin.
- new format added: you can now input both (+-)dd°mm'ss" and dd°mm'ss"(N, S, W, E). Letters are not supported in WGS84 representation.
- if you are unwilling to seek degree sing in manual input, just press the appropriate button (°)
- minutes sigh is apostrophe ('), seconds one - is double qoute("). If I am not right please contact me
- after right input press the (>) button and view the result
- ----------------
# in the next version
- batch convert
- gpx generator
